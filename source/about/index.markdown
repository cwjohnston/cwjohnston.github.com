My name is Cameron Johnston, I'm an American Linux systems architect and administrator.

You can follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/cwjohnston">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://github.com/cwjohnston">GitHub</a>.

I'm a big fan of Opscode's [Chef](http://www.opscode.com/chef/) configuration management system. I like to contribute to the Chef community by helping people in [#chef on freenode](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/IRC) where my nickname is `cwj`.

I use Chef to deploy and manage Linux infrastructure at <a href="http://www.needle.com">Needle</a>, where we are building a community-driven 'fan-sourcing' platform for driving ecommerce sales. Opinions expressed here are my own and do not reflect those of my employer.

I am a road cycling enthusiast and enjoy both watching professional cycling and participating in one hundred mile "century" rides. Like most people I enjoy good coffee, good food, international travel and live music.
